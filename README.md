# ReplicationProjects

:fire: Replication of various papers, to which I also add a pdf file with comments both on the paper and on the figures. 

:fire: Looking for feedback: both on the efficiency of the implementation and the coding style. These re-implementations are made to be criticized and learn from it!

- The replications are done either in julia or python. 
- The goal for me is not to criticize the author work, which I always assume to be of high quality. Indeed, as a student I still have a lot to learn before being able to argue on the implementation of a model. Nonetheless, I will add a description of how hard I found it to replicate the work, from a student perspective.
- Sometimes I will focus on the main figures.
- Additional explorations may be proposed at the end of the work.

Most papers will be either machine learning or computational neuroscience papers.
